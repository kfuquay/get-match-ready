#Get Match Ready

An application which helps users keep up with Championship football teams. Users can look up information about any EFL Championship team - including current season's stats, recent news, and details about the team's next match.

##Motivation

I wanted an easy way to find information about my favourite Championship football team.  Users can quickly and easily find team info about any Championship team.
